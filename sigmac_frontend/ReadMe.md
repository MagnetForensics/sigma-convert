# SigmaC Frontend
This is the frontend crate built using Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs) framework.

## Setting up
You will need a couple of tools to compile, build, package and debug this frontend. 
We are using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) to bundle the crate as a WASM web app.
### Requirements
- Rust >=1.56.1
- The WebAssembly Target.

    `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Trunk. 
 
    `cargo install --locked trunk`
- Tailwind CSS. This is required for development as we use Tailwind css for styling the app.

## Building
While building for development, we use the trunk crate for hot reloading. To build and serve the application locally, run the following command.  

`trunk serve`  

Trunk will rebuild your application if you modify any of its source code files.


## Deployment
To build TailwindCSS use the command

`tailwindcss -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./tailwind.css`

To build the frontend for deployment, run the following command:

`trunk build --release`

This builds the app in release mode.  Set up your HTTP server so that it 
serves index.html whenever your site is visited, and requests to static 
paths like index_<hash>.js and index_bg_<hash>.wasm are served with the 
contents of their respective contents from the dist directory generated by 
trunk.

Once built copy-paste the contents of the `dist` directory to the `sigmac-api-server/dist` directory.
